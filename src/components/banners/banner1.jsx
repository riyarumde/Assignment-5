<p>The importance of a balanced diet canâ€™t be emphasized 
    enough for a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can
     be attained by maintaining a balanced diet and keeping
      into consideration to meet all the essential nutrients
       required by the body. A proper meal plan helps to attain
        ideal body weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases
         like diabetes, cardiovascular and other types of cancer.</p>
